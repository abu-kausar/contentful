            More details below. In this era of mass incarceration, the
            school-to-prison-pipeline system is more invested in locking up
            youth than unlocking their minds. Our current education system uses
            harsh discipline policies that push Black students out of schools at
            disproportionate rates; denies Black students the right to learn
            about their culture and whitewashes the curriculum to exclude many
            of Black peoples&apos; and other folks of color&apos;s struggles and
            contributions. Our education system pushes Black teachers out of
            schools in Seattle-King County, and across the country, and spends
            way more money on imprisoning people than on educating them.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-4">
            The system&apos;s focus on punishment enables police to commit acts
            of violence against Black folks and communities on such a large
            scale. It is long past time for the City of Seattle to correct its
            misplaced spending priorities.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-4">
            The City spends at least $409 million annually on the police. We
            know that a real approach to public safety would, instead, redirect
            those funds to nurses, counselors, school psychologists, Ethnic
            Studies, Black students, hiring more Black teachers, and other
            social programs to support our youth.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-4">
            Seattle&apos;s Mayor and Council must protect, expand investments to
            make our communities safe, prioritizing community-led public health
            and safety strategies.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-4">
            &quot;It&apos;s time we rethink the role of police in our community
            and the effect they have on harm reduction and growth as opposed to
            black educators, counselors, and psychologists. Rather than
            allocating resources to further militarize the police, we want to
            fund community-run programs to support BIPOC youth,&quot; said
            Garfield BSU Senator and Black Education Activist, Bethel Getu.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-4">
            This includes full access to youth mentorship programs, affordable
            housing, community-based anti-violence programs, trauma services and
            treatment, universal childcare, and more.

            <strong>YOUTH-LED SOLUTIONS FOR BLACK EDUCATION:</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="py-3 font-bold">1. Community Schools Now!</p>
          <p className="py-3">
            The City of Seattle and Martin Luther King Jr. County must reinvest
            funding from its criminal legal budget and into funds for Community
            Schools, at every school servicing 70% or more students on free and
            reduced lunch. Funding for Community Schools must provide health
            care, eye care, social and emotional services. In addition, these
            schools must provide and free, healthy, and culturally relevant
            meals. Services must be available before, during, and after school,
            and year-round to the full community. Funding must include a
            Community School Coordinator to facilitate the development and
            implementation of the community schools&apos; strategic plan in
            collaboration with school and parents/community members/partners and
            to ensure alignment of solutions and needs.
          </p>
          <p className="py-3 font-bold">2. Restorative Justice Now!</p>
          <p className="py-3">
            The City of Seattle and Martin Luther King County must pay for a
            restorative justice counselor in every school and the creation of a
            parent/youth/community restorative justice council at every school.
            The restorative justice council would join peace circles to mediate
            conflicts in the school, review school discipline data, and help
            create strategic goals for community building and healing centered
            education. This council would facilitate a restorative process both
            between students, and between students and educators.
          </p>
          <p className="py-3 font-bold">
            3. Black Studies and Ethnic Studies Now!
          </p>
          <p className="py-3">
            The Seattle Public Schools, with financial support from the City of
            Seattle, must fully fund Ethnic Studies—including a Black Studies
            course—at every school, Kindergarten through 12th grade. In
            addition, Financial Literacy and LifeSkills must be taught in our
            schools to empower BIPOC students. Black Studies and Ethnic Studies
            must become a graduation requirement.
          </p>
          <p className="py-3 font-bold">4. Hire Black Teachers Now!</p>
          <p className="py-3">
            Local colleges, Seattle Public Schools, and the office of the
            Washington State Superintendent for Public instruction must convene
            a &quot;Black Teachers Now&quot; task force to hire and retain more Black
            teachers. The City of Seattle and Martin Luther King Jr. County must
            reallocate funds from the legal system towards providing affordable
            housing for Black teachers to live and thrive in place.
          </p>
          <p className="py-3 font-bold">
            5. Anti-racist Professional Development Now!
          </p>
          <p className="py-3">
            The Seattle Public Schools must implement a robust anti-racist
            professional development course required for all educators—i.e.,
            including teachers, admin, nurses, paraprofessionals, librarians,
            and office professionals. This course would not be a one-time
            training, but instead, provide ongoing trainings throughout the
            school year and educators&apos; careers. This course should include
            antiracist historical lessons, pedagogical methods, assessment
            strategies, and identity self-exploration to learn how to
            effectively teach for Black lives. Training would also address the
            that institutional racism and racialized anger bias has led
            educators to disproportionately—and violently—call 911 on Black
            children, and provide alternative strategies for healing centered
            de-escalation and community building.
          </p>
          <p className="py-3 font-bold">6. Accountability Now!</p>
          <p className="py-3">
            Educators, administrators, security, and staff that physically abuse
            a student must be held accountable. Too often, school systems
            cover-up or dismiss instances of abuse in the schools—especially
            abuses perpetrated against a Black student. Any school staff
            reported to have physically abused a student should be suspended
            immediately pending an investigation. Such staff must submit to
            restorative justice practices and procedures. Accountability for
            abuse may include immediate firing for staff and for any school
            district official who removes evidence of abuse from an educator or
            administrator&apos;s file as well.
          </p>
          <p className="py-3 font-bold">7. Student Representation Now!</p>
          <p className="py-3">
            The Seattle School board must add at least two BIPOC high school
            student representatives to its board. In addition, the Seattle
            School Board needs to meet monthly with representatives from local
            youth organizations that serve BIPOC students, e.g., NAACP Youth
            Council, Africatown Center for Education & Innovation, African
            American Male Student Leadership Council, Black and Brown Minds
            Matter, United Better Thinking, Black Student Unions, youth in the
            Community Passageways and Creative Justice programs, among others.
          </p>
          <p className="py-3 font-bold">8. Youth Achievement Center Now!</p>
          <p className="py-3">
            The City of Seattle and Martin Luther King Jr. County must allocate
            funds to support the creation of the Youth Achievement Center—a
            holistic co-housing complex that is designed to support homeless
            students, students historically underserved, and system involving
            youth. This co-housing facility would provide housing, culturally
            relevant food, freedom educational programming, tutoring services,
            mentoring classes, trauma counseling, college and career counseling,
            and other supports.
          </p>
          <p className="py-3 font-bold">9. Community Control of Schools Now!</p>
          <p className="py-3">
            African American Academy and Horace Mann Building: Work with the
            Black community to develop interventions and programs that
            specifically address Black children&apos;s unique experiences. Fulfill
            the commitment to Africatown Center for Education & Innovation to
            return to Horace Mann to address the ongoing state of emergency for
            Black students in Seattle Public Schools. Restore African American
            Academy under community control to implement the necessary education
            solutions. Implement recommendations from the African American Task
            Force, Equity Race Advisory Committee of Seattle Public School,
            African American Males Advisory Committee, etc.
          </p>
          <p className="py-3 font-bold">
            10. Community Control of Education Resources and Levy Funds Now!
          </p>
          <p className="py-3">
            Community Control over resources that are intended to impact our
            lives such as the Education Levy funds. Far too often, data about
            the state of emergency for the Black community is used to receive
            financial resources, yet the Black community itself does not receive
            such funding to address the issues within community. Far too often,
            such resources are given to white-led organizations to lead the
            work—we&apos;ve seen millions funneled into the non-profit industrial
            complex to largely white-led organizations and yet we&apos;ve seen no
            improvements for decades. The Black community has the expertise,
            know-how, cultural competency, insight and plan to service its
            education and community needs. We demand control of our education
            resources now!
