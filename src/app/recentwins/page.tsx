            Juneteenth 2024, King County Equity Now celebrated four years of
            steadfast advocacy and significant victories for the Black
            community. We extend heartfelt thanks to YOU, our incredible
            supporters. Your support is driving an impressive 300,000 actions
            towards advancing equity over the past four years! Despite
            persistent attempts to undermine KCENâ€™s Juneteenth celebration, the
            event once again triumphed as a resounding success. Featuring
            electrifying sets by Dead Prez, performances, DJ Holiday, and the
            culmination of a season of local action, advocacy, and storytelling,
            it was a vibrant intergenerational gathering that provided space for
            Black joy and jubilation alongside our ongoing fight for justice and
            equity.

            Challenges Ahead
          </h2>
          <p>
            Despite these advancements, significant obstacles persist.
            Nationally and locally, there are ongoing efforts to disenfranchise
            the Black community, destabilize progress, and fund initiatives like
            the Fairness and Families agenda. Efforts in Evanston, IL, and even
            the state of reparations to Tulsa Race Massacre survivors are
            alarming.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Locally, attempts to divert funds from the Community Reinvestment
            Program, Participatory Budgeting, and the Equitable Development
            Initiative are concerning. Additionally, recent city planning lacks
            equitable strategies to protect vulnerable communities from
            displacement.

            Call to Action
          </h2>
          <p>
            We urge non-Black-led organizations to refrain from competing for
            resources intended for Black communities. This perpetuates inequity
            and undermines our efforts towards justice and equality.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Nonprofit Industrial Complex has grown into a billion-dollar
            industry over 50 years, disproportionately benefitting white
            organizations while Black communities have faced ongoing decline.
            This disparity must end immediately.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We also call for an end to the use of Black organizations as tokens
            by non-Black entities. Black communities are fully capable of
            directing and managing resources through our own channels.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="pb-10">
            With Juneteenth now a national holiday, we call upon our supporters
            to honor its significance by recommitting to supporting our critical
            work. Together, we can dismantle systemic inequities and establish a
            new norm rooted in equity for Seattle and Martin Luther King Jr.
            County.
